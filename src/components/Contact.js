        Daisy Sarah Bacon (May 23, 1898 â€“ March 1, 1986) was an American pulp
        fiction magazine editor and writer who was best known as the editor of
        Love Story Magazine from 1928 to 1947. She moved to New York in 1917,
        working at several jobs before being hired in 1926 by Street & Smith, a
        major pulp magazine publisher, to assist with "Friends in Need", an
        advice column in Love Story Magazine. Two years later she was promoted
        to editor of the magazine, and stayed in that role for nearly twenty
        years. Love Story was one of the most successful pulp magazines, and
        Bacon was frequently interviewed about her role and her opinions of
        modern romance. Some interviews commented on the contrast between her
        personal life as a single woman, and the romance in the stories she
        edited; she did not reveal in these interviews that she had a long
        affair with a married man, Henry Miller, whose wife was the writer Alice
        Duer Miller. Street & Smith gave Bacon other magazines to edit:
        Ainslee's in the mid-1930s and Pocket Love in the late 1930s; neither
        lasted until 1940. In 1940 she took over as editor of Romantic Range,
        which featured love stories set in the American West, and the following
        year she was also given the editorship of Detective Story. Romantic
        Range and Love Story ceased publication in 1947, but in 1948 she became
        the editor of both The Shadow and Doc Savage, two of Street & Smith's
        hero pulps. However, Street & Smith shut down all their pulps the
        following April, and she was let go. In 1954 she published a book, Love
        Story Writer, about writing romance stories. She wrote a romance novel
        of her own in the 1930s but could not get it published, and in the 1950s
        also worked on a novel set in the publishing industry. She struggled
        with depression and alcoholism for much of her life and attempted
        suicide at least once. After she died, a scholarship fund was
        established in her name.
